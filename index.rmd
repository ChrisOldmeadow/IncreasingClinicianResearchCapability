# HMRI Research Support System Design
## Increasing Clinician Research Capability

### `r Sys.Date()`

```{r setup, include=FALSE, fig.retina = 3}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
library(knitr)
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, dpi = 180)
library(ggplot2)
#library(silgelib)
library(emo)


```


 
# What is the current problem?



-  HMRI is to increase the amount of T3-T4 translation research
- `r emo::ji("demon")`  There are no/limited pathways for clinicians to develop research capability
- `r emo::ji("demon")`  Blockages at the interface between HNELHD, UoN and HMRI 



---
class: inverse 
 
# What is the purpose of this exploration?

--


.content-box-blue[ 
 To develop a prototype model where HMRI can facilitate research pathways/ capability development for clinicians within the HNELHD. 
]

Benefits:
- To UoN: More grant funding, higher quality papers, more papers accepted
- To HNE: Better patient care

# Critical Questions? 

--
- How are the key stakeholders (either help or hinder)
- What are the stakeholder and organisational objectives?
    - Are we trying to train better researchers or do better clinically relevant research
- How do we define research capacity development?


---
# Critical Questions? 

- What is the span of operation and activities (individual, organisation, network)
- What are the mechanisms that support meaningful research capability development 

- What are the barriers to the implementation of any system/framework
  - How to motivate a research environment
  - How to support research naive groups




---

# Key stakeholders to speak to

- Peter Pockney (UoN/HNE - surgery)
- Liz Sullivan (UoN)
- John Attia (UoN/HNE)
- John wiggers (UoN/HNE)
- Maralyn Foureur (Uon/HNE nursing)
- "consumers"

# Do we need more trained researchers?

![paper](paper1.png)

* a set of purposefully coordinated components that target multiple levels and sectors of a system, that operate both independently and inter-dependently, and that interact in the contexts in which they are implemented
* *empowering* and *enabling* different levels of the health research system to conduct research

---
# What are the possible components to the system:
  - Prioritisation of research areas / clincial problems; 
  - Mentoring for research; 
  - Research leadership; 
  - Research facilitation; 
  - Research skills training; 
  - Funding (including phillanthropy, grants and fellowships); 
  - Networks and collaborations; Infrastructure.

---
# Program theories (other than just training)

Signalling the importance of Research Capability Development
- Positive role models
- Signal importance
- Make a difference

Functional aspects:
- Liberate talents
- Release Resources
- Learning by doing
- Co-production of knowledge

# Summary from Pete Pockney

- Clinical Research Fellowship for trainee surgeons
- Introduced to increase rates of acceptance into Advanced training
- Potentially transferable to other areas in medicine
- works well when jobs can be split
- Key aspects: Administration, Projects
- Risks : In other areas retaining these researchers as clinicians



---
#  Alternative ways to achieve the purpose 

- team based, e.g. the embedded economist/statistician/implementation scientist
- utilising/adapting current resource


---
# Where to from here?
