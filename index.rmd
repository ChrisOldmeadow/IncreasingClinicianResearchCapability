# HMRI Research Support System Design
## Increasing Clinician Research Capability

options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)

# What is the current problem?



-  HMRI is to increase the amount of T3-T4 translation research
- `r emo::ji("demon")`  There are no/limited pathways for clinicians to develop research capability
- `r emo::ji("demon")`  Blockages at the interface between HNELHD, UoN and HMRI 
-  clinicians that are active in research  provide better care to patients

# What is the purpose of this exploration?

--


.content-box-blue[ 
 To develop a prototype model where HMRI can facilitate research pathways/ capability development for clinicians within the HNELHD.

# Critical Questions? 

--

- What are the stakeholder and  organisational objectives?
- Are we trying to train better researchers or do better clinically relevant research
- How do we define research capacity development?

    
- what is the span of operation and activities (individual, organisation, network)
- what are the mechanisms that support meaningful RCD 






---
- What are the possible models
  -Prioritisation; 
  - Mentoring for research; 
  - Research leadership; 
  - Research facilitation; 
  - Research skills training; 
  - Funding (including bursaries and fellowships); 
  - Networks and collaborations; Infrastructure.

# Key stakeholders to speak to

- Peter Pockney (UoN/HNE - surgery)
- Liz Sullivan (UoN)
- John Attia (UoN/HNE)
- John wiggers (UoN/HNE)
- Maralyn Foureur (Uon/HNE nursing)
- "consumers"
---
# Summary from Pete Pockney

- Clinical Research Fellowship for trainee surgeons
- Introduced to increase rates of acceptance into Advanced training
- Potentially transferable to other areas in medicine
- works well when jobs can be split
- Key aspects: Administration, Projects
- Risks : In other areas retaining these researchers as clinicians

# do we need more trained researchers?

![paper](paper1.png)
*""“a set of purposefully coordinated components that target multiple levels and sectors of a system, that operate both independently and inter-dependently, and that interact in the contexts in which they are implemented”"
* "empowering and enabling different levels of the health research system to conduct research"

---
# Program theories (other than just training)

Signalling the importance of Research Capability Development
- Positive role models
- signal importance
- make a difference
Functional aspects
- Liberate talents
- release Resources
- Learning by doing
- co-production of knowledge




---
#  Alternative ways to achieve the purpose 

- team based, e.g. the embedded economist/statistician/implementation scientist
- utilising/adapting current resource


---
# Where to from here?
